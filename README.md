# krono

A Kotlin port of https://github.com/wanasit/chrono

## Why Kotlin?

- Kotlin is a modern language that is fully interoperable with Java.
- Translating the original TypeScript code to Kotlin is easier than to Java.

## Limitations

- Unfortunately, due to necessity to convert Java `Duration` class to Big Decimal Seconds, Krono requires java.base/java.time to be opened to the module.

## Porting progress
